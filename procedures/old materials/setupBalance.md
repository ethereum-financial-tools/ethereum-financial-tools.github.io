# Operational Process Balance

## Workflow using `BALANC3`

1. Setting up balanc3:
  - Adding wallets: `Maurice and Rob`
  - Naming transactions and wallet addresses: `Maurice and Markus`
		- => for having more clarity in the accounting. These new denominations are saved

2. Using balanc3 to record financial transactions (Maurice and other multi-sig signatories)
  - Simply by using wallets (making transactions) that are added in balanc3. All the required data is downloaded into balanc3 from the blockchain
    - => only the invoice according to each transaction has to be uploaded by Maurice, the rest of the data is automatically taken from the blockchain by balanc3

3. Using balanc3 as a financial management tool (Amber, Aya, Patrick, Catherine, Mauriceâ€¦)
  - Analysing assets and liabilities of all different wallets and cryptocurrencies in one fiat currency (USD)
    - => this allows us to always have an overview of our general balance in real time and in USD

4. Using balance to do the accounting under Swiss law (Markus and Heike)
  - Taking the required data from balanc3 for doing the accounting simply by downloading a CSV file
    - => If the naming of transactions and addresses is well done and if all according invoices are uploaded, the accountants have what they need
